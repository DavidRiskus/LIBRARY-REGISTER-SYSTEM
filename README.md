inside the LIBRARY-REGISTER-SYSTEM/back-end run:

```
npm install
```
'node_modules' folder with node.js dependencies will be retrieved.

## Running the Server

Start the server with:

This will start the server running on `127.0.0.1` port `3000`.

## Check everything is working correctly

To check the database and server are operating correctly you can open `http://127.0.0.1:3000/authors` in a Web Browser. This should return a JSON representation of all the Authors stored in the database.


## Making requests

Requests to the server can be made to the endpoints specified in `server.js`. For details on the Models and the Fields they contain, check `data.js`
