# CMT112-CW2-Library Server

## Installation

Download and install all requirements for the server with:

```
npm install
```

## Initialising a Database

Before you run the server for the first time, you should ensure there is a database available for it to read and write to. You can initialise the database with:

```
node initialise_database.js
```

This will create a `library.sqlite` file inside the `data/` directory and pre-populate it with some sample data.

**CAUTION!** Running this command will remove any data already stored in the database `data/library.sqlite`. It should be used with caution, only when you want to reset the Database to its initial state.

## Running the Server

Start the server with:

```
node server.js
```

This will start the server running on `127.0.0.1` port `3000`.

## Check everything is working correctly

To check the database and server are operating correctly you can open `http://127.0.0.1:3000/authors` in a Web Browser. This should return a JSON representation of all the Authors stored in the database.

## Making requests

Requests to the server can be made to the endpoints specified in `server.js`. For details on the Models and the Fields they contain, check `data.js`

## Editing the server

The Node server uses the [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) library for interacting with the SQLite database.

It uses the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework for running the web server and routing queries.

## Server Test Page

This repository also contains a server test page - `server_test.html`. This can be used both to check the server is operating correctly and to act as an example of how to make requests to the server.
